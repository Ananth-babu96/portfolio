/*   <p className="about-ph">
               I am a passionate front-end developer with a keen eye for detail
               and a deep love for crafting engaging user interfaces. My journey
               in web development began with a fascination for how design and
               functionality come together to create seamless user experiences.
               Over the years, I have honed my skills in various technologies,
               with a particular focus on React, Bootstrap, and Sass.
            </p>
            <p className="about-ph">
               With React, I build dynamic and responsive applications that not
               only meet but exceed user expectations. My proficiency in
               Bootstrap allows me to rapidly prototype and develop mobile-first
               websites that are both visually appealing and functionally
               robust. Additionally, my expertise in Sass ensures that my
               stylesheets are organized, maintainable, and scalable, enabling
               efficient project management and collaboration.
            </p>
            <p className="about-ph">
               Driven by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning, I
               stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in
               front-end development. I take pride in writing clean, efficient
               code and enjoy solving complex problems to deliver high-quality
               solutions. Whether working on a team or independently, I am
               dedicated to creating user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing
               interfaces that leave a lasting impression.
